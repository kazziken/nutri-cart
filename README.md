Nutri-Cart

The new and accessible handling of your nutrition. An app where you can add all of your foods, ingredients, and vitamins into a cart in order to see all of the nutritional facts all calculated together for you!

Have you ever wondered about all of the calories, total carbs, sodium, sugar, and other nutritional facts you are consuming per eating session. The foods we are consuming have a ton of different components. We tend to know the baseline of what weâ€™re eating but there's no good way to curate that content and learn from it all in one place.

That is where Nutri-Cart comes in...

Simply create an account, add all the foods or ingredients to your "cart" and you will be able to view all of the information added up.

Nutri-cart will automatically log the cart under the date and time that you created it.

You can edit or delete your cart at anytime.

Level up your nutrition today!
